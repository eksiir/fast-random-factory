# fast-random-factory

Yet another random number generator - Not!

It is a wrapper for your choice of random generator to cache and yield its results very fast when called repeatedly.
<br>
Consider an array of <strong>cacheSize</strong> elements,
<ol>
    <li>Each element of the array is a random number between min and max, generated by your choice of random generator.</li>
    <li>The array is (optionally) shuffled.</li>
    <li>An element of that array is returned at every call.</li>
    <li>When all the elements are consumed, the cache array is recreated again which guarantees an endless supply.</li>
</ol>
